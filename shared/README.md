# Zod Schemas Shared Library

A shared library for using Zod schemas on both the backend and the frontend

## Usage
Schemas are stored in `./src/zodSchemas.ts`. Here we can import the schemas generated by `zod-prisma-types` from Prisma models located in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and modify them if necessary.

Additional constraints on fields and other custom validators can be applied to the models in the `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` with rich comments (triple slashes `///`). Refer to the [zod-prisma-types docs](https://github.com/chrishoermann/zod-prisma-types#field-validators) for more info.


## Updating Schemas

To update the generated schemas, navigate to the backend directory and execute the following script:

```bash
npm run genSchemas
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. Runs `npx prisma generate` to update Prisma client and generate the schemas.
2. Uses the `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` plugin to automatically remove the unused Prisma client import in `./src/generated/zod/index.ts.` This is a work-around so we don't have to do it manually.

### Dependencies: 

- Zod
